CS86 -- Theo Dayton

For HW4: Current functionality is the add button adding a
battleship to the model, and the remove button clearing all the
battleships from the model. Currently the ships are randomly
selected (right now from battleships and submarines, which have
different shapes), and their position and size are also randomly
selected. The scrollbars also change the x and y values of all
the ships, so that the user can move the radar around. Toggle
button now simply rotates the ships 90 degress.

For some reason the ships are flickering on screen, im guessing
from the paintComponent method being called repeatedly. I will go
to next OH to have this fixed
