CS86 -- Theo Dayton

For HW6: Current functionality is the speed up and speed down which changes the
speed at which the ships move. The toggle button also allows the user to stop
and resume the movement of the ships. When the toggle button is pressed, 
interacting with the speed up and speed down buttons is not allowed, so the
user is not allowed to press those buttons until the user resumes the movement.
There is also a combobox, a scrollbar with a label, and an "add ship" button, which will add the type of ship that was selected in the combobox, with the
length specified in the scrollbar. Then the "Delete ship" button will delete
any ship selected by the user. If the user fails to select one it will say so
in the console. Finally the "Clear all" button will delete all ships on screen.
The user can select ships by clicking on them in the canvas, and when doing so
will unselect any other that was previously selected. The program also has a
layout that changes based on the size of the window. If the window is too small
tha layout will change to take up less space. For example, when the window
get small enough, the speedup and slowdown button will dissapear, as well as the
scrollbar and label at the top.

Regarding collisions: The program implements collision detection in the sense
that, when adding ships, the program will detect whether it collides with any
of the other ships. If they do, it will look for another place to create the
ship. If it takes too long to find space, it will stop the search and say so in
the console.
