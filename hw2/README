CS86 -- Theo Dayton


My program will be a ship radar display which will show a number of ships moving around.  The drawing canvas will be in the middle, and there will be widgets on the sides. On the north, I will have two regular buttons that will create a new ship on the radar every time is pressed, and another one which will instead delete a random ship. On the west, On the south, I will have a scrollbar which will move where the radar is point left or right, which will cause the ships in the radar to move in the opposite direction. Likewise, there will be a scrollbar on the east, which will do the exact same, but move the radar up or down. On the west, there will be a toggle button which, when toggled, will activate the weapons system, which will destroy a ship every X seconds while active.

Inheritance hierarchy:

Button superclass:
    -Add ship button
    -Delete ship button

Scrollbar superclass:
    -Horizontal scrollbar
    -Vertical scrollbar

Aggregation hierarchy:

All the widgets will need able to access and edit the individual ship objects
