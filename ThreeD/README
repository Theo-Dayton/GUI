CS86 -- Theo Dayton

For ThreeD : This program allows the user to create three different types
of ships in a 3D world. First a Battleship which is represented by a cube, then
a submarine which is represented by a sphere, and finally a UFO which is 
represented by a capsule with a dodecahedron on top of it. The dodecahedron
on top of the capsule is a moving part. There is a button for creating each
one of these ships. The location of the ships is slightly random. The user
can also move the ships either left or right by using the buttons. 

How to compile and run:
No compiling is required, just access hw10.html on a browser

(I tried to extend a Ship superclass to subclasses but was not working,
so I decided to make seperate classes instead)
