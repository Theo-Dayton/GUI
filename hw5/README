CS86 -- Theo Dayton

For HW5: Current functionality is the speed up and speed down which changes the
speed at which the ships move. The toggle button also allows the user to stop
and resume the movement of the ships. When the toggle button is pressed, 
interacting with the speed up and speed down buttons is not allowed, so the
user is not allowed to press those buttons until the user resumes the movement.
There is also a combobox, a scrollbar and an "add ship" button, which will add
the type of ship that was selected in the combobox, with the length specified
in the scrollbar. Finally, the clear button will remove all the ships from the
screen.
