CS86 -- Theo Dayton


My program will be a ship radar display which will show a number of ships moving around.  The drawing canvas will be in the middle, and there will be widgets on the sides. On the north, I will have two regular buttons that will create a new ship on the radar every time is pressed, and another one which will instead delete a random ship. On the west, On the south, I will have a scrollbar which will move where the radar is point left or right, which will cause the ships in the radar to move in the opposite direction. Likewise, there will be a scrollbar on the east, which will do the exact same, but move the radar up or down. On the west, there will be a toggle button which, when toggled, will activate the weapons system, which will destroy a ship every X seconds while active.

For HW3: The only functionality is the add button adding a new ship (rectangle),
and the delete button deleting it. Currently the ships are randomly placed on the
screen, and they also have random sizes, this might change in the future. The
scrollbars also change the x and y values of the rectangle, so that the user
can move the radar around. Toggle button has no functionality. Once buttons
get more complex i will create new subclass for each one
